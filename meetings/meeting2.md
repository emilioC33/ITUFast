# Meeting 2 (5. Nov 2018)

start with slow scale

    - 100 pop + 100 gen
    - if there are differences we might try one approach in the cloud

masking tests

    - initially without masks (learn that its not that important)
    - maybe try it with a mask (speedup?)

reward

    - based on segments

for the next time

    - non visual?
    - make the setup work
